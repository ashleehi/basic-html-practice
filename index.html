   <h1>My Nail Journey</h1> 
   <h2>At The Start</h2>
   <p>I have been doing nails ever since I turned 13 and got a nail kit for my birthday. That means we are going on <em>3 years</em> now. A couple months before my 13th birthday I spent my time watching tiktoks of people doing acrylics and something about it was so satisfying so when I saw an acrylic kit at the store I just knew I had to get it. The minute I got home I started right away. The stench of the monomer was very <strong>pungent</strong>. I had everything laid out and I attempted to sculpt my first nail. I failed <em>miserably</em>. This put me off wanting to do nails for a hot minute. This was until I discovered polygel. </p>
   
   <h2>My Progress</h2>
   <p>From then to now:</p>
   <ol>
    <li>In 2020 I used polygel and dual forms </li>
    <li>In 2021 I used polygel with free forms</li>
    <li>In 2022 I used builder gel with nail tips</li>
    <li>In 2023 I used the Gel-X method</li>
   </ol>

   <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
   <p>Everytime I go to the nail supply store my mom has to be prepared to make a big investment. Never have I once walked out of the store with a receipt of less than 30 bucks and I go to there <em>a lot</em>. My favorite compliment is when I tell people I do my own nails and they are like, "No you did not!". I definetly feel like i have made progress throughout the years and now my friends and classmates come to me when they need their nails done and I am happy to oblige. It is funny how I can't draw a stick figure to save my life but when it comes to painting little characters on tiny little nails I can go pretty hard. So basically hmu if you want nails.
